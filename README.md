# RPG-Project
Project for creating an RPG in C/C++
The game itself will be an RPG with plans to implement random encounters, menus, inventory system, XP, walking/running only, party members, turn system, map, saving, etc. The idea is to have two maps/levels for the player to grind, fight, and explore through. At the eventual end of each level, there will be a boss.
